# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Home Assistant custom integration for monitoring and controlling Kubernetes clusters. Python 3.13+, async throughout, uses the official `kubernetes` Python client.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
KubernetesClient (API calls) → KubernetesDataCoordinator (polling/caching) → Entities (sensors/switches/binary_sensors)
```

When the experimental **Watch API** is enabled:
```
KubernetesClient.watch_stream() → KubernetesDataCoordinator._run_watch_loop() → coordinator.data updated + async_update_listeners()
```

**Sidebar panel:**
```
Browser (kubernetes-panel) → hass.callWS() → websocket_api.py → KubernetesDataCoordinator
```

**Entry point:** `__init__.py` sets up the integration lifecycle. On config entry setup, it creates a `KubernetesClient`, wraps it in a `KubernetesDataCoordinator`, then forwards setup to three platforms: `sensor`, `switch`, `binary_sensor`. On the first config entry, it also registers HA services, WebSocket commands (via `async_setup`), and the sidebar panel. If the `enable_watch` option is set, watch tasks are also started after the first refresh.

### Key Modules

- **`kubernetes_client.py`** — Async wrapper around the k8s Python client. Fetches deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, cronjobs, pods, nodes. Handles SSL, auth, namespace filtering, and error deduplication (5-min cooldown). Also provides `watch_stream()` (async generator), `list_resource_with_version()`, `ResourceVersionExpired` exception, and single-item parse helpers (`_parse_pod_item`, `_parse_node_item`, `_parse_deployment_item`, `_parse_statefulset_item`, `_parse_daemonset_item`) used by the coordinator watch loop.
- **`coordinator.py`** — Extends HA's `DataUpdateCoordinator`. Polls the cluster on an interval (60 s default, 300 s when watch is active), aggregates all resources into lookup dicts, handles orphaned device cleanup. When watch is enabled, also manages background watch tasks (`async_start_watch_tasks`, `async_stop_watch_tasks`, `_run_watch_loop`, `_apply_watch_event`).
- **`sensor.py`** — Aggregate count sensors (pods, nodes, deployments, cronjobs, jobs, etc.) and per-resource sensors (individual node/pod/cronjob/job metrics).
- **`switch.py`** — Scale control for Deployments/StatefulSets (on=running, off=scaled to 0) and CronJob suspension. Includes verification timeouts and cooldowns.
- **`binary_sensor.py`** — Cluster health connectivity indicator and per-node condition binary sensors (MemoryPressure, DiskPressure, PIDPressure, NetworkUnavailable).
- **`services.py`** — Three HA services: `scale_workload`, `start_workload`, `stop_workload`. Support targeting multiple entities.
- **`device.py`** — Device registry management. Two grouping modes: `namespace` (entities grouped by namespace) or `cluster` (all under one device).
- **`config_flow.py`** — UI configuration flow. Validates cluster connectivity. Lazy-imports kubernetes to handle missing dependency gracefully. Contains `KubernetesOptionsFlow` for configuring the experimental watch API toggle. Also contains a reconfigure flow (`async_step_reconfigure` / `async_step_reconfigure_namespaces`) for modifying existing entries without deleting and re-adding the integration.
- **`websocket_api.py`** — WebSocket API for the sidebar panel. Registers `kubernetes/cluster/overview` command that aggregates coordinator data across all config entries. Returns cluster health, resource counts, namespace breakdown, and alerts (node pressure, degraded workloads, failed pods).
- **`const.py`** — All constants, config keys, defaults, sensor/switch type identifiers. Includes watch-related constants: `CONF_ENABLE_WATCH`, `DEFAULT_WATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `DEFAULT_WATCH_RECONNECT_DELAY`, `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_POLL_INTERVAL`. Panel constants: `PANEL_TITLE`, `PANEL_ICON`, `PANEL_URL`, `PANEL_FILENAME`. `DOMAIN_META_KEYS` for filtering non-entry keys from `hass.data[DOMAIN]`.
- **`frontend/`** — Built sidebar panel JS bundle (`kubernetes-panel.js`). Source lives in `frontend/` at project root (Lit 3 + TypeScript + Vite).

### Entity Hierarchy

Cluster device → (optional) Namespace devices → Entity instances. Grouping mode is configurable via `device_grouping_mode`.

### Patterns

- All entities read cached data from the coordinator, never calling the K8s API directly.
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest — test functions are automatically treated as async.
- Tests mock HA and the K8s client via fixtures in `conftest.py` (`mock_hass`, `mock_config_entry`, `mock_client`, `mock_coordinator`).
- The kubernetes package is lazy-imported in config_flow and checked at setup to handle missing dependency.

## Code Style

- **Ruff** for linting and formatting (replaces black, isort, flake8). 88-char line length.
- Type hints encouraged but mypy is not strict (`disallow_untyped_defs = false`)
- Prefer `aiohttp` over the blocking kubernetes client for new async HTTP calls
- All integration code must use `async`/`await` — no blocking calls
- Inside coroutines always use `asyncio.get_running_loop()`, never `asyncio.get_event_loop()` (deprecated in Python 3.10+ within a running loop)
- For long-lived aiohttp streams (`total=None`) always set a `sock_read` timeout to guard against stale/half-open TCP connections
- In `async_setup_entry`, start any background tasks **after** `async_forward_entry_setups()` so entity listeners are registered before the first events can arrive

## CI

GitHub Actions runs: pytest + ruff + mypy + bandit (Python 3.14), HACS validation, hassfest (HA manifest validation), mkdocs build, frontend lint + build (ESLint, Prettier, Vite). Releases automated via release-please.

## Tests

Whenever changes are implemented to any integration code, always add or update the corresponding unit tests in `tests/`. Follow the existing patterns in the test files:

- Each new class gets a corresponding `Test<ClassName>` test class.
- Each new module-level helper function gets a `TestDiscover<Name>` or similar test class.
- Cover the happy path, edge cases (missing data, `None` coordinator data), and all distinct return values.
- Use the shared fixtures from `conftest.py` (`mock_hass`, `mock_config_entry`, `mock_client`, `mock_coordinator`) rather than creating new ones where possible.
- Do not attempt to run tests locally — the CI pipeline handles test execution.

## Documentation

Whenever changes are implemented, update all relevant documentation to reflect the current state of the code. This includes `README.md`, files in `docs/`, and any other `.md` files in the repository. Do not leave documentation that describes outdated behaviour.

Before finishing any task, fully review **all** `.md` files in the repository — including `README.md`, every file under `docs/`, and `CLAUDE.md` itself — to confirm that no documentation has become stale as a result of the change. Pay particular attention to installation instructions, configuration references, and RBAC/manifest paths, as these are the most likely to drift when the project structure changes.

## Version Management

Renovate handles all dependency updates. When making any change that involves version pinning or introduces a new dependency, always check `renovate.json` and ensure the version is tracked and grouped correctly:

- Versions pinned in `pyproject.toml` are managed by Renovate's pip manager.
- Versions pinned in `custom_components/kubernetes/manifest.json` are tracked via a custom regex manager.
- Pre-commit hook versions in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` are managed by Renovate's pre-commit manager.
- When the same package appears in multiple files, add a `groupName` rule in `renovate.json` so updates are batched into a single PR.
